The origin of the position embedding sizing `0::2` and `1::2` in the provided code relates to the alternating use of sine and cosine functions for even and odd indices of the embedding dimensions. This approach is based on the positional encoding method introduced in the "Attention Is All You Need" paper, which proposed the Transformer architecture.

## Positional Encoding Formula

The positional encoding is defined by the following formulas:

$$PE_{(pos, 2i)} = \sin\left(\frac{pos}{10000^{2i/d_{model}}}\right)$$
$$PE_{(pos, 2i+1)} = \cos\left(\frac{pos}{10000^{2i/d_{model}}}\right)$$

Where:
- `pos` is the position
- `i` is the dimension index
- `d_model` is the embedding dimension

## Implementation Details

In the provided code, this formula is implemented as follows:

1. **Initialization**: 
   ```python
   positional_embeddings = torch.zeros(seq_len, d_model)
   ```
   This creates a tensor to store the positional embeddings.

2. **Position and Dimension Vectors**:
   ```python
   positional_sequence_vector = torch.arange(0, seq_len, dtype=torch.float).unsqueeze(1)
   positional_model_vector = torch.exp(torch.arange(0, d_model, 2).float() * (-math.log(10000.0) / d_model))
   ```
   These lines create vectors for positions and dimensions.

3. **Applying Sine and Cosine**:
   ```python
   positional_embeddings[:, 0::2] = torch.sin(positional_sequence_vector * positional_model_vector)
   positional_embeddings[:, 1::2] = torch.cos(positional_sequence_vector * positional_model_vector)
   ```

   This is where `0::2` and `1::2` come into play:
   - `0::2` selects even indices (0, 2, 4, ...)
   - `1::2` selects odd indices (1, 3, 5, ...)

   By using these slices, the code efficiently applies:
   - Sine function to even indices
   - Cosine function to odd indices

## Advantages of This Approach

1. **Unique Encoding**: Each position gets a unique encoding.
2. **Fixed Frequency**: The frequency for each dimension is fixed, allowing the model to extrapolate to sequence lengths longer than those seen during training.
3. **Smooth Transition**: The use of sine and cosine functions ensures a smooth transition between positions.
4. **Bounded Values**: The values are always between -1 and 1, regardless of sequence length.

This method of positional encoding has proven effective in capturing relative positions and allowing the Transformer model to understand the order of elements in the input sequence[2][4][6].
