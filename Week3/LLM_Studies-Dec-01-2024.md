# Studies

- Let's make a zarf package of vllm using the example in leapfrogai and see if we can get that to work in a k3d cluster.
- I got this to work (https://docs.zarf.dev/ref/examples/podinfo-flux/)

## [[Elon Musk]] on AI's Future (Source: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3JkkWfzc4Jg)

### AI Development and Impact
- AI capability is increasing rapidly, potentially 10 times better per year.
- Could match human capabilities within 1-2 years
- By 2028-2029, AI might be able to do what all humans combined can do.
- 80-90% chance AI will be beneficial, 10-20% chance it could go badly. What this means he leave undefined
  but I can guess what it means.

### AI Safety and Ethics
- Most important aspect: creating a "maximally truth-seeking AI" that loves humanity. This is hos Musk differenates himself
  from OpenAI and others who inject woke opinions into their opinions that contain falsehoods because it is politically correct.
- Concern about AI being trained with biased philosophies popular in the Bay Area California.
- Created xAI to develop an AI that is maximally truth-seeking and aspires to benefit humanity

### Future of Energy and Computation
- Long-term energy will primarily come from solar sources
- Tremendous demand for energy to power digital intelligence and electrification of transport
- Every country likely to have its own AI compute clusters

### Robotics and Automation
- By 2040, potentially over 10 billion humanoid robots
- Price point for a versatile robot around $20,000-$25,000
- Predicts a future of abundance in goods and services

### Space Exploration
- SpaceX aims for uncrewed Starships to Mars in about two years, human missions two years after
- Optimistic about reaching Mars before the end of the decade

### Autonomous Vehicles
- Tesla expects unsupervised full self-driving in the US next year with Model 3 and Y
- Anticipates exceeding human safety levels in Q2 of the following year
- Projects 9.5 million cars on the road by end of next year, growing to over 100 million autonomous vehicles

### Economic Impact
- Autonomy could make Tesla a $5 trillion company
- Optimus robot could make Tesla a $25 trillion company
- Predicts transition to a post-capitalist cashless society with universal high income

## Future of AI Beyond ChatGPT (Source: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gokc8A6Qkik)

### AI's Rapid Evolution and Impact
- Transforming finance, leadership, education, and medicine
- Predicted 5-20x increase in content creation in the next decade

### Multimodal AI and New Frontiers
- Future AI models will integrate text, images, video, sound, and protein structures
- Potential to revolutionize drug discovery and treatment

### AI and Work Productivity
- Expected to dramatically increase productivity across industries
- Workers transitioning from individual contributors to AI managers

### AI Development and Competition
- Global race with different strengths between U.S. and Chinese companies
- U.S. companies more innovative, Chinese companies excel in engineering and execution

### Cost-Effective AI Development
- Some companies achieving high-performance AI models at lower costs
- Resource constraints driving innovation

### Advice for Future Generations
- Debate on prioritizing coding vs understanding AI concepts
- "Spoken English is the programming language of the future."
- Combining AI knowledge with personal passions crucial for success
