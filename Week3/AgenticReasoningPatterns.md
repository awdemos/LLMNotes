Agentic reasoning design patterns are sophisticated strategies that enable AI agents, particularly those powered by large language models (LLMs), to solve complex problems more effectively. These patterns allow AI agents to think, act, and collaborate in ways that mimic human problem-solving approaches. There are four key agentic reasoning design patterns:

## Reflection

Reflection is a pattern where the AI agent evaluates and improves its own responses. Instead of simply accepting its initial output, the agent:

1. Generates an initial response
2. Critically examines its work
3. Refines the response based on self-evaluation

This iterative process allows for continuous improvement of the agent's output. Examples of reflection implementation include:

- The CRITIC framework, which verifies LLM responses against external tools and iteratively improves them[1].
- The Self-Refine approach, where the LLM provides feedback on its own output and refines it until a defined stop condition is met[1].

## Tool Use

The Tool Use pattern enables AI agents to interact with external functions, modules, or APIs to gather information or perform specific actions. This pattern:

- Allows LLMs to connect to external resources like web searches or API calls
- Enables the agent to select the most appropriate tool based on the task and context

Notable implementations of Tool Use include:

- The Chain of Abstraction method, which separates general reasoning from domain-specific knowledge available through external tools[1].
- Gorilla, a fine-tuned model specifically designed for making AI and ML-based API calls without hallucination[1].

## Planning

In the Planning pattern, the AI agent breaks down complex tasks into smaller, manageable steps. This approach involves:

- Asking the model to outline the steps needed to accomplish a task
- Breaking down topics into subtasks
- Using tools to complete individual steps and passing parameters between them

Examples of Planning in action include:

- Chain of Thought Prompting, which mimics the human thought process of breaking down complicated reasoning tasks[1].
- The Plan-and-Execute paradigm, where a planner establishes a series of necessary steps to reach a solution, and executors carry out those steps[3].

## Multi-Agent Collaboration

This pattern involves multiple AI agents working together to solve complex problems. It's similar to how human specialists collaborate on projects. Key aspects include:

- Assigning different roles or specialties to various agents
- Enabling communication and coordination between agents
- Combining diverse capabilities to tackle complex tasks

Examples of Multi-Agent Collaboration include:

- ChatDev, which simulates a virtual software development company with agents assigned to various roles[1].
- AutoGen, an open-source framework that allows for a combination of human input, tools, and LLMs to build applications[1].
- The Group Chat pattern, where multiple specialized agents (e.g., product manager, code assistant, code executor) collaborate under the guidance of a chat manager[3].
- The Supervision pattern, which introduces a senior agent to structure work and control quality in a hierarchical team of agents[3].

These agentic reasoning design patterns represent a significant advancement in AI capabilities, allowing for more autonomous, flexible, and powerful problem-solving. As research progresses, we can expect AI agents to become increasingly capable of managing diverse and complex tasks in real-world environments[2].
